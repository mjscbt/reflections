When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I want to have multiple people working on a project, it makes sense
    to set up a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Remote changes may not be necessary for the work I'm doing at the moment
    so I might not want automatically update. If I'm off-site and only have
    internet access via my mobile phone, updating automatically will use
    much of my available traffic.
