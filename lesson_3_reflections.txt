When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I want to have multiple people working on a project, it makes sense
    to set up a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Remote changes may not be necessary for the work I'm doing at the moment
    so I might not want automatically update. If I'm off-site and only have
    internet access via my mobile phone, updating automatically will use
    much of my available traffic.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is an online clone of a repository that shows from where it was 
    forked (linked). A clone is a local copy copy of a repository. A branch
    is a label inside a repository. Fork are used to build on an existing 
    repository. Clones are used for local copies of repositories and a
    branch is used to divert from the normal commit history. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having the last known state of the remote stored locally gives me
    information on where my version ist compared to the remote e.g.
    ahead or behind.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Working together would be a lot harder without GitHub because sharing and
    merging the different releases woul be tedious. One could imagine all 
    contributers sittig in one room, which would make it easier to resolve 
    issues.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
